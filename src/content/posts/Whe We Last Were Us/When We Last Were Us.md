# Two voices echo through a shared past, revisiting the rooms where love once lived & silence learned their names.

Two voices. One place. Never again the same.

A quiet condo filled with shadows of memory, where love once lived & silence now stays.

Quiet. Poetic. Told entirely in dialogue between two voices echoing through a shared past.

This is a story about what we keep, what we lose, and the places that remember us even when we don’t return.

**HER:**

Your name’s not on the mailbox anymore.  
I stood there like it still should be.  
The doorknob still sticks.  
The walls didn’t know how to forget you either.  
They looked at me like I was the stranger.

---

**HIM:**

You came back.  
I didn’t think you would.  
The key still works.  
But it doesn’t sound like welcome anymore.  
More like memory. Creaking.

---

**HER:**

The blue sweater’s gone.  
The one that smelled like coffee and weekend mornings.  
Did you take it?  
Or did it finally stop waiting?

---

**HIM:**

It’s in the closet behind the boxes.  
I told myself I’d donate it.  
But I never did.  
Like if I kept it,  
something soft would still exist between us.

---

**HER:**

The fridge hums in E minor.  
Still lonely.  
Still loyal.  
I checked the back,  
your jar of olives was gone.  
You hated olives.  
But you never threw them out.

---

**HIM:**

I liked having one thing in there  
that never needed me.  
That never spoiled.  
That stayed.

---

**HER:**

The plant on the balcony leans too far.  
Like it’s trying to escape the glass.  
I wonder if it remembers  
when we danced barefoot  
in the hallway  
with spoons on our noses.  
Just to make each other laugh.

---

**HIM:**

That was the last time I saw your full smile.  
No shadow in it.  
No weight.

---

**HER:**

You were the loud one.  
But when you hurt,  
you went silent.  
You disappeared  
without ever leaving.

---

**HIM:**

Frankie still runs to the window  
when it rains.  
He thinks you’re coming home.

---

**HER:**

I threw your mug once.  
The one with the chipped lip.  
I don’t know why.  
I just needed something to break  
that wasn’t me.

---

**HIM:**

I loved you here.  
Even when I didn’t say it.  
Especially then.  
I thought you knew.

---

**HER:**

I almost told you I’d stay.  
I almost begged.  
But you looked tired  
of holding me together.

---

**HIM:**

You were right to go.  
I made the place too heavy.  
I made love feel like  
something you had to survive.

---

**HER:**

Do you ever think,  
if I had turned around that day,  
would you have stopped me?

---

**HIM:**

I would have.  
I almost did.  
But you were already too far  
and I was already too late.

---

**HER:**

I saw your name  
in a baby announcement last fall.  
Not mine.  
Not ours.  
But still, it hit me  
like the hallway light flicking on  
at the wrong hour.

---

**HER:**

I found a grape stem on the balcony.  
Dried.  
Still shaped like a wishbone.  
I almost made a wish,  
but didn’t know who’d win.

---

**HIM:**

I can’t believe I remember how your voice sounded.  
I thought forgetting would be harder than dying.

---

**HER:**

I left a letter in the wall.  
Behind the light switch.  
I don’t know if you ever found it.  
It didn’t say much,  
just “Don’t forget the way I held your hand  
when you were scared.”

---

**HIM:**

If these walls still talk,  
I hope they lie.  
Tell the next couple  
we were the kind of people who made it.

---

**HER:**

Tell them  
we tried.  
Tell them it wasn’t all my fault.  
Tell them I never stopped waiting  
to hear the lock turn.

---

**HIM:**

If someone else moves in,  
don’t tell them everything.  
Keep one memory  
just for me.

---

**HER:**

You stopped loving me  
before I stopped needing you.

---

**HIM:**

I know.

---

**HER:**

Do you remember what we used to say  
before we locked the door?

---

**HIM:**

“Always leave the light on.”

---

**HER (final whisper):**

I still do.  
Just not for you anymore.
