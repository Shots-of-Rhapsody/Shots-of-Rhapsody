# He sits where she once did, caught between what was said & what was never spoken.

The tea house sits at the end of an old street where lanterns hang low and the air smells faintly of jasmine and wet stone. He comes here most afternoons, though he never tells himself why. The owner does not ask. She only nods, wipes the table, and sets the same small cup in front of him.

He likes the seat by the window where sunlight moves slowly across the wooden counter. It catches in the steam, turns it gold for a moment, then leaves it to fade. That is how he measures time now, by how long it takes the tea to cool.

The first sip is always too hot. The second, too late.

Years ago, he sat in this same chair across from her. She was always late, always smiling when she arrived as if time forgave her. He would tease her about it, pretending to be annoyed. She would roll her eyes and steal his cup.

“You worry too much,” she said.
“Someone has to.”
“Then let it be someone else.”

She had a way of making everything sound lighter than it was. Even promises.

He traces the rim of the cup now, his hand steady but cold. He remembers the day she stopped coming. There were no arguments, no slammed doors. Only absence, deliberate and quiet. He told himself he did not need to chase her. Pride, he thought, was a kind of dignity.

It took him years to see it was only fear pretending to be reason.

The owner refills his cup. He nods his thanks. The tea swirls, color deepening. He watches the surface settle, waiting for it to stop trembling. It never quite does.

Sometimes, when the door opens, he looks up expecting her. The smallest movement can trick him. A voice in the corner, a coat the same color as the one she used to wear. But it is always someone else.

The world goes on. It has to.

He once tried to forget. Burned the letters, washed the sheets, threw away the scarf that still carried her scent. But memory is not something you can bury. It is vapor. It seeps through everything you try to seal.

He remembers her laughter the way he remembers pain, by what it left behind.

The rain begins, soft against the paper windows. He closes his eyes. In the sound of it, she returns again. Not as she was, not warm or close, but as something quieter. Like the space between heartbeats.

He thinks of all the words he never said and how they would sound now. He would tell her he was wrong. That he was scared. That waiting was never the same as staying.

He opens his eyes. The tea is cold.

The owner asks if he would like another pot.
He shakes his head. “Not today.”
She nods, takes the cup, and leaves the table empty.

He stays a little longer, staring at the faint ring of condensation left behind. The light has faded, and outside the window the street shimmers with rain.

He stands, places a few coins beside the cup, and looks once at the chair across from him, still unclaimed, perfectly waiting.

When he steps outside, the air is heavy and sweet. He pulls his coat close, breathes in the scent of wet leaves, and for a moment imagines her walking beside him.

The thought hurts less than it used to.

By the time he reaches the corner, the tea house is already dim behind the rain. All that remains of her is the memory of steam rising and disappearing, exactly the way love does when you stop paying attention.

This version preserves its fragility and silence. Each paragraph holds space for breath, as if the story itself is exhaling loss. It reads as though it has already been waiting on the page for years.
